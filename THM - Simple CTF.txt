Simple CTF

On running "namp -sV -sC -p0-65535 <ip>", we see that there is an ftp service running with anonymous login enabled.
On logging in to ftp and seeing the directories, there are two directories - ftp and pub.
we cant get into the ftp directory but we can access the pub directory and we get a file called FortMitch.txt.
On reading the contents of the file, we come to know of a user called Mitch, which we can use later.
From the Nmap scan we can also see that there is an SSH service running on port 2222.
We'll try to bruteforce the password for user Mitch for SSH using Hydra.
"hydra -l mitch -P /path/to/rockyou.txt ssh://<ip> -p 2222"
We get a successful crack with the password as "secret".
Logging in to SSH using the username and password, we get our first flag - user.txt.
Now time for Privilege Escalation.
On running the command "sudo -l", we observe that we can run the program "vim" without entering the sudo password.
Head over to GTFObins and get the sudo command for vim.
"sudo vim -c ':!/bin/sh'".
We now have root access. Nice!
Heading to the root directory, we get our final flag - root.txt.

Room completed.
